This program will take in several command line arguments (or else be default) and will determine if the input file contains palindromes.

Must execute command "make" in order to run.

Usage: "./master -h" for help. "-n x" to set total numbers of lines to read. "-s x" to set max number of processes to occur at once. "-t x" to set max program run time. "-i f" to set an input file. Where x is an integer and f is the name of a file.

Problems:
Some warnings when compiling, program still runs.
Program currently set up to fork a single line of input into palin.c.
Cannot get exec to work which is why there is only a single iteration at a time. I do not know what I am doing wrong.
Shared memory has not been instituted as I have had trouble making exec work properly even without shared memory.
No signals instituted, they are not needed at this point anyway.
